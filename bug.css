The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class.  The error occurs because the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class is only supported in modern browsers and does not work as expected in older browsers.  In older browsers the focus style (outlined) will always be applied.

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```
