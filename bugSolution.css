To address this issue, we can utilize a JavaScript polyfill, such as the one provided by the `focus-visible` npm package. Here's how you can integrate the polyfill and maintain CSS styling consistency:

1. **Install the polyfill:**
```bash
npm install focus-visible
```
2. **Import the polyfill:** Import `focus-visible.js` in your HTML file (typically in your main js file)
```html
<script src="path/to/focus-visible.js"></script>
```
3. **CSS remains the same:**  The CSS code requires no modification after integrating the polyfill. The polyfill will handle the browser compatibility issues.

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

By including the polyfill, your CSS will now function correctly across all supported browsers, resolving the unexpected focus style issue in older versions.
